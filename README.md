*What is SPCM in Hippotherapy?*

The Hippotherapy App is a sophisticated web-based application designed
to streamline the process of managing patient information, performing
assessments, and generating reports for therapists conducting
hippotherapy sessions. It enables therapists to create, view, and manage
detailed patient profiles, storing crucial information such as contact

for the recording and saving of evaluations conducted before and after
therapy sessions, facilitating the tracking of patient progress over
time. Data security is a top priority, ensuring that patient and

solutions. Additionally, the app supports research efforts by providing
anonymized data that researchers can use to generate insightful reports,
contributing to the advancement of hippotherapy practices. The
user-friendly interface offers easy navigation through a well-designed
dashboard, simplifying the entry and retrieval of patient and assessment
